# Final-Project-6623
Project that allows users to manage their inventory and purchases

In order to run this program you need:
1.Computer
2.Microsoft Excel
3.Internet
4.Web Browser
5.Any IDE that supports Java, (I use IntelliJ IDEA)

You are going to need a Excel reading library so you will be able to read excel spread sheets within the IDE.
When you run the program and complete it, it will export excel  file into the folder. Do not delete the Inventory.cvs and do not delete Own.cvs

In Order to run the program, you hit the run buttom in any IDE you have.
